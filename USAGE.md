## OOC Messages

OOC messages are Out Of Character messages, generally
used in roleplays to speak out of your character,
for example telling your friend you are AFK.

Some examples of OOC messages include:
- `((no you cant do that`
- `//bro stop`
- `im afk))`

Sometimes the roleplay channel may be filled with
OOC messages. To help you with this, 
Akiyama has two little commands for you.

> `.clearooc`

Clears OOC messages in the channel. If you dont have
the permissions to delete others' messages, Akiyama
will only delete your own OOC messages.

> `.autoclearooc [duration]`

**Requires:** administrator permissions

This is a setting, when set, Akiyama will delete any OOC message
after *duration* seconds.

Also, if an OOC message has `!` as the message's *3rd* character,
(ex: `((! hi`) Akiyama will not automatically delete it.
This is useful when the other person is taking too long to respond.

To turn off this feature, you can type `.autoclearooc off`
